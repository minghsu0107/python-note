    "Let's see which restaurant location has had the most extreme improvement in its scores. Let the \"swing\" of a restaurant location be defined as the difference between its highest-ever and lowest-ever score. **Only consider restaurant locations with at least 3 scores—that is, restaurants that were rated at least 3 times.** Assign `max_swing` to the name of the restaurant that has the maximum swing. \n",

    "We have not provided any skeleton, as there are many paths to getting the correct answer. The recommended approach to solving this problem is to break it down into smaller chunks (e.g., first, ensure all restaurants have at least 3 scores; second, compute ... ). This will likely require more than one line, so feel free to add/remove columns and define new temporary variables. Remember to assign your solution - a string containing the `name` of the restaurant location that experienced the most extreme improvement - to `max_swing` after you do so. \n",
