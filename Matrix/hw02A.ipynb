It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops / comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n",
